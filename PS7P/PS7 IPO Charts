CIS 106 – Loops Part 2

For each problem prepare an IPO chart. Then write the code for each. Save the IPO within this document and upload to your repository. After code is complete upload the files (.py) to your repository. Paste the link to your repository into the assignment completion link in Blackboard. 

1.	Allow the user to enter a principle amount and interest rate repeatedly (need a loop to control the program execution). Compute the annual interest (principle x rate). Compute ending balance to be principle (beginning balance + interest). Display year, beginning balance and ending balance for each of the 5 years. Display the accumulated interest for the 5 years. Note:  the new balance by year (this will be the principle for the following year. Format the output. 
Example:
Enter principle amount: 10000.00
Enter interest rate: 0.10

Year           Beginning	    Ending
                      Balance	   Balance
1	   $10,000.00       $11,000.00
2	   $11,000.00       $12,100.00
3	   $12,100.00       $13,310.00
4	   $13,310.00       $14,641.00
5	   $14,641.00       $16,105.00
Total interest earned: $6,156.00  
Input	Process	Output
Principle 
		
Interest amount	For count in range (1,6, 1):
AIR = principle x rate 
ending = principle + AIR

	Year count
Balance Starting 
Amount Ending
	Principle = eb	
		
		
		
		

2.	Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of natural order. The sequence is:
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 etc
Use of for loop compute and display first 20 numbers in the sequence. Hint: start with 1 , 1.



Input	Processing	
A = 1	C = a + b	Print c 
B =1	b = c 	
	a = b	
		
		
		
		


3.	Create a text file that contains employee last name and salary. Read in this data. Determine the bonus rate based on the chart below. Use that rate to compute bonus.  For each line display the employee last name, salary and bonus. After the loop display the sum of all bonuses paid out. 
Salary			Bonus Rate
100,000.00 and up	      20%
50,000.00		      15%
All other salaries	      10%

Example file (create your own data with at least 5 lines:
Adams
50000.00
Baker
75000.00
Smith
45000.00
Etc 
Inputs	process	Outputs
Name	Get name 
Get salary 

If salary > 100000 
Bonus = 20%	Name

Salary	If salary is > 50000 
Bonus = 15%	Bonus
Salary
	Else bonus = 10%	
	 Final Salary = Salary * bonus + salary	
		
		After loop display

		Bonuses sum 

4.	Create a text file with item, quantity and price. Read through the file one line at a time. Compute the extended price (quantity x price). For each line display the item, quantity, price and extended price. After the loop display the sum of all the extended prices, the count of the number of orders and the average order.

input	Proccess	Output
		
Item	C = 0

Qty	Get item
While item != “”
Get qty* price
Ep= qty * price

Totep=totetp + ep	Item 
Price

	Avg = tot ep / c 	C 
Tot ep

	Display c , totep, avg 	
		





5.	Create a text file with student last name, district code (I or O) and number of credits taken. Compute tuition owed (credits taken x cost per credit). Cost per credit for in district students (district code I) is 250.00. Out of district students pay 500.00 per credit. For each line display student last name, credits taken and tuition owed. After the loop display sum of all tuition owed and the number of students.

Dcode	While not at end
Get dcode , credits

If decode = “I”
CPC = 250
Else
Cpc = 500

Tuition = cpc * credits

C= c+1
Tt= tt + tuition
Display name, credits, tuition

Get next last name	Last name
